# Churn-Prediction
Analysed churn behaviour for a fast growing video streaming platform. The dataset contains user information with each row representing a unique subscriber. The dataset was cleaned, making any necessary changes to ensure consistency and completeness. Missing values and duplicates were handled appropriately, new features were added to the dataset, and encoding of categorical variables was done for further statistical analysis. Hypothesis testing was conducted to check if churn was related to variables such as gender and receiving promotions and if watch time differs significantly between churned and retained users

Built a logistic regression model to predict future churners so proactive steps can be taken to retain customers. Split data into training and testing sets, scaled features and fitted the model to data. Model was evaluated with a confusion matrix, precision, recall and f1 score. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted with area under curve (AUC) score labelled for further evaluation. The most important predictors of churn from the model coefficients were identified.
